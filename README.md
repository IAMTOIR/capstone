## Introduction
For this project I was interested in predicting customer churn for a fictional music streaming company: Sparkify.
Predicting churn rates is a challenging and common problem that data scientists and analysts regularly encounter in any customer-facing business. Additionally, the ability to efficiently manipulate large datasets with Spark is one of the highest-demand skills in the field of data.

In this project:
- Load and clean dataset with PySpark and Pandas
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data 
- Perfrom Feature Engineering to create and useful features for the churn analysis
- Modelling using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes

## Requirements
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pyspark
